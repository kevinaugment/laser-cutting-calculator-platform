# PRD: Memory & Preset System for Laser Cutting Calculators

## Executive Summary

A practical memory system that allows users to save, organize, and reuse parameter settings across all laser cutting calculators, plus a comprehensive admin dashboard for content management, SEO optimization, and usage analytics. This system addresses the real user need of avoiding repetitive data entry while providing powerful tools for managing educational content, optimizing search visibility, and tracking platform performance. The implementation will be simple, fast, SEO-optimized, and feature a unified professional design that meets manufacturing industry aesthetic standards.

**Value Proposition**: Save 10-15 minutes per session by eliminating repetitive parameter entry, improve workflow consistency, enhance SEO visibility through centralized content and meta management, provide a cohesive professional appearance that builds user trust, streamline educational content publishing, and gain actionable insights through comprehensive analytics.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Repetitive Parameter Entry**: Laser cutting professionals repeatedly enter the same material thickness, power settings, and cutting speeds for similar jobs
2. **No Settings Persistence**: Users lose their optimized parameters when refreshing the page or switching between calculators
3. **Workflow Inefficiency**: Time wasted re-entering known good parameters for recurring laser cutting tasks
4. **Poor SEO Performance**: Calculator pages lack structured data and optimized content for laser cutting search queries
5. **Inconsistent Design**: Different calculators have varying layouts, colors, and UI patterns that look unprofessional
6. **Non-Industry Standard Aesthetics**: Current design doesn't match the professional appearance expected in manufacturing environments
7. **No Usage Insights**: Unable to track which calculators are most popular or identify optimization opportunities
8. **No Performance Monitoring**: Lack of visibility into platform performance and user behavior patterns
9. **Manual SEO Management**: Difficult to update meta titles, descriptions, and SEO settings across all pages
10. **Content Publishing Challenges**: No streamlined way to publish and manage educational blog posts about laser cutting

### Why Now?
- User feedback specifically requests "save my settings" functionality
- SEO competition requires better optimization for laser cutting calculator searches
- Need to consolidate and clean up existing calculator codebase
- Simple memory features are table stakes for professional tools
- Professional appearance is critical for credibility in manufacturing industry
- Inconsistent design hurts user trust and conversion rates
- Content marketing through educational blogs is essential for SEO growth
- Manual SEO management is time-consuming and error-prone
