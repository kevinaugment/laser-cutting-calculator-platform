## Data Models

### Team Management
```typescript
interface Team {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  settings: TeamSettings;
  memberCount: number;
  isActive: boolean;
}

interface TeamMember {
  id: string;
  teamId: string;
  userId: string;
  role: TeamRole;
  permissions: TeamPermission[];
  joinedAt: Date;
  invitedBy: string;
  status: MemberStatus;
}

interface TeamInvitation {
  id: string;
  teamId: string;
  email: string;
  role: TeamRole;
  invitedBy: string;
  invitedAt: Date;
  expiresAt: Date;
  status: InvitationStatus;
  token: string;
}
```

### Team Parameter Library
```typescript
interface TeamParameterPreset extends ParameterPreset {
  teamId: string;
  visibility: PresetVisibility;
  sharedBy: string;
  sharedAt: Date;
  collaborators: string[];
  tags: string[];
  rating: PresetRating;
  comments: PresetComment[];
  usageStats: PresetUsageStats;
  version: number;
  versionHistory: PresetVersion[];
}

interface PresetComment {
  id: string;
  presetId: string;
  userId: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  parentId?: string;
  reactions: CommentReaction[];
}

interface PresetRating {
  averageRating: number;
  totalRatings: number;
  ratingDistribution: Record<number, number>;
}
```

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Sub-100ms response time for team operations
- Efficient caching for frequently accessed team data
- Optimized queries for large team libraries
- Real-time updates for team collaboration

### Security
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure team invitation system
- Data encryption for sensitive team information
- Audit logging for team operations

### Scalability
- Support for teams up to 100 members
- Handle libraries with 1000+ parameter presets
- Efficient search and filtering for large datasets
- Horizontal scaling for team operations

## Integration Points

### Existing Services
