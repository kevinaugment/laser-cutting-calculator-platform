2. **Recovery Phase** (15-30 minutes)
   - Stop application services to prevent data corruption
   - Restore from most recent consistent backup
   - Apply transaction logs to minimize data loss
   - Verify data integrity and consistency

3. **Validation Phase** (10 minutes)
   - Run automated data validation tests
   - Verify critical business functions
   - Check data relationships and constraints
   - Confirm backup and replication resumption

#### Application Recovery
1. **Service Restoration** (10 minutes)
   - Deploy application from backup images
   - Restore configuration and environment variables
   - Verify service dependencies and connections
   - Start services in correct dependency order

2. **Traffic Restoration** (5 minutes)
   - Update load balancer configurations
   - Gradually restore traffic routing
   - Monitor service health and performance
   - Verify end-to-end functionality

#### Infrastructure Recovery
1. **Infrastructure Assessment** (15 minutes)
   - Evaluate hardware and network status
   - Identify failed components and dependencies
   - Determine recovery approach and timeline
   - Activate secondary infrastructure if needed

2. **System Recovery** (30-60 minutes)
   - Restore or replace failed infrastructure
   - Deploy system configurations and updates
   - Verify network connectivity and security
