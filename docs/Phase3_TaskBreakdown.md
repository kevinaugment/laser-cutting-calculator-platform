- Follow the implementation plan **step by step**; do not skip or merge steps arbitrarily.  
- After each step, **self-verify output correctness and completeness** before continuing.  
- If a step fails, retry up to **4 times maximum**, with logging of cause.  
- If 4 consecutive retries fail, apply **fallback strategy**:
  1) Choose alternative valid route (different API/library/method), OR  
  2) Mark the step as "needs manual review" and continue with next priority.  
- Strictly avoid: code duplication, unnecessary dependency additions, unsafe defaults (no hard‑coded secrets, permissions, unencrypted data).  
- Optimize for clarity, maintainability, and minimal resource consumption. 
- After each error is completely corrected, write the experience to Memories to avoid recurrence
